Characteristic weights
----------------------
Weights of all fitted points are equal to a "data weight" of between
0 and (usually) 1.0 (reflecting the degree of confidence on the measurement),
multiplied by a "characteristic weight" for the measured quantity.

Note that the "characteristc weight" values below have been modified 
(for emfs and {delta}Hdil) to reflect the fact that some "data weights" 
in the files are >1.0.  


1. {delta}Hdil:  1.2934D-3  (Units: J mol-1)
2. phiCp:        3.7D-2     (Units: J mol-1 K-1) 
3. emf:          4.4D6      (Units: V) 
4. isopiestic:   4.3D4  
5. alpha:        60.D0

Notes about the weights:
------------------------

1. {delta}Hdil: listed "characteristic weight" = 5.80D-4  
Weights in the data file range from 0 (excluded) to a maximum of 2.23
This means the weighting factor is 5.80E-4 * 2.23 = 1.2934E-3 (for 
measurements in J mol-1)  

2. phiCp: listed "characteristic weight" =  3.7D-2  
The highest weights in the data file are 1.0, with some points given a lower 
weight (as low as 0.1) reflecting a lower degree of confidence in the result.
This means the weighting factor is 3.7E-2 * 1 = 3.7E-2.

3. emf: listed "characteristic weight" = 2.2E6
Weights in the data file are, for some reason, either (0 excluded) or 2.
This means the weighting factor is 2.2E6 * 2 = 4.4E6 (for measurements in V)  

4. isopiestic: listed "characteristic weight" = 4.3E4 
The highest weights in the data file are 1.0, with some points given a lower 
weight (as low as 0.1) reflecting a lower degree of confidence in the result.
This means the weighting factor is 4.3E4 * 1 = 4.3E4.

5. alpha:  listed "characteristic weight" =  60
Weights in the data file are either 0 (excluded) or 1.
This means the weighting factor is 60 * 1 = 60.
