# Data tables

*The casual user has no need to explicitly call this module.*

`.tables` contains tables of parameters that can be conveniently looked up by the model parameter functions.

The way this module is used by Pytzer is still being developed. More documentation will be added once the best approach has been determined. Only the still-incomplete **MIAMI** coefficient library includes functions that use this module.
