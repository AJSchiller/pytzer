# Data tables

*The casual user has no need to explicitly call this module.*

**pytzer.tables** contains tables of coefficients that can be conveniently looked up by functions in **pytzer.coeffs**.

The way this module is used by Pytzer is still being developed. More documentation will be added once the best approach has been determined. Only the still-incomplete **MIAMI** coefficient library includes functions that use this module.
